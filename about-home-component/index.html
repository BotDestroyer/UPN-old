                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Seeing a need for energetic, nonprofit work in the Upcounty, we formed our organization to provide educational outreach and community programming that focuses on the well-being of our youth. We've steadily grown since then, all thanks to the helping hands of this amazing community!</p>
